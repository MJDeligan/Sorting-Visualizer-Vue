## Overview
This is a visualization of popular sorting algorithms made with Vue using the Vuetify Component Library. 
Included algorithms: 
- Insertion Sort
- Cocktail-shaker Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Everyone's favorite: Bogo Sort  
  
Allows the user to control certain variables such as the speed at which the visualization happens ranging from very slow to get a solid understanding of the little steps happening during the algorithm to very fast( even instantaneous). The values are randomly generated and the number of values can be controlled. 
Elements are colored differently depending on their role and state. Unsorted values are blue, sorted values are green, values that are being compared are red, pivots (Quick Sort) are purple and current max elements (Selection Sort) are orange.
